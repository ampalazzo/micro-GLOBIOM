# Introduction
GLOBIOM has been designed as global asssessment tool. Most input data is defined at the [0.5 degree] spatial level. Recently, there has been increasing demand for regional and subnational assessments that focus an a specific geographical region. Examples are land use change studies for Brazil, Congo, Ethiopa and Indonesia and an assessment of the water-land-energy nexus in the Zambezi and Indus river basins.The global datasets that are normally used for assessments are too coarse to arrive at the level of detail that is demanded for this type of studies and therefore needs to be replaced more detailed information that have a higher spatial resolution, if available.  

This document describes the various steps to prepare GLOBIOM for regional or subnational assessments. 

To explain the methodology, we use the XX study
